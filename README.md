##About The Project

There are instagram users that need to keep their accounts because they didnÂ´t remember, this is a funny way to do an annotation, using xml and dtd to keep the account annoted its the best way to keep it for a programmer

Here's why:

* A programer have an idea of the code and normal people dont have this idea
* A programer its simply different :smile:

Of course, the code its free to use and download but if you want to do a donation thank you!
